     * This method is called when a message arrives from the server.

     * <p>
     * This method is invoked synchronously by the MQTT client. An
     * acknowledgment is not sent back to the server until this
     * method returns cleanly.</p>
     * <p>
     * If an implementation of this method throws an <code>Exception</code>, then the
     * client will be shut down.  When the client is next re-connected, any QoS
     * 1 or 2 messages will be redelivered by the server.</p>
     * <p>
     * Any additional messages which arrive while an
     * implementation of this method is running, will build up in memory, and
     * will then back up on the network.</p>
     * <p>
     * If an application needs to persist data, then it
     * should ensure the data is persisted prior to returning from this method, as
     * after returning from this method, the message is considered to have been
     * delivered, and will not be reproducible.</p>
     * <p>
     * It is possible to send a new message within an implementation of this callback
     * (for example, a response to this message), but the implementation must not
     * disconnect the client, as it will be impossible to send an acknowledgment for
     * the message being processed, and a deadlock will occur.</p>
     *
     * @param topic   name of the topic on the message was published to
     * @param message the actual message.
     * @throws Exception if a terminal error has occurred, and the client should be
     *                   shut down.
